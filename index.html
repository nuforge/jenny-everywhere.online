            <p>Either way, it's a day, and <a>Jenny Everywhere</a> is banging on your apartment window.
            </p>

            <p>"<em>Get your jetpack, we're late!</em>" she yells, her <a>🧣scarf</a> flapping dramatically, even though
                there's no wind. She doesn't seem to care that you're still in pajamas—or that jetpacks aren't real (or
                so you thought).</p>

            <p>You stumble to the window, pulling it open. Jenny grins, radiating that effortless <a>😎confidence</a>
                that
                makes you want to believe she knows exactly what's going on... even though she probably doesn't. 😏
            </p>

            <p>Behind her, a glowing green <a>🟢portal</a> hums ominously in the middle of the street, swirling with
                unearthly energy.</p>

            <p>A dude with a mohawk and a flamethrower casually steps out, his expression as calm as if he's just
                picking up groceries.</p>
