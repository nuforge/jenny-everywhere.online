## You wake up on a Monday. Or is it Tuesday?

Either way, it's a day, and [Jenny Everywhere](jenny_everywhere) is banging on your apartment window.

"*Get your jetpack, we're late!*" she yells, her [🧣scarf](scarf) flapping dramatically, even though there's no wind. She doesn't seem to care that you're still in pajamas—or that jetpacks aren't real (or so you thought).

You stumble to the window, pulling it open. Jenny grins, radiating that effortless [😎confidence](confidence) that makes you want to believe she knows exactly what's going on... even though she probably doesn't. 😏


Behind her, a glowing green [🟢portal](portal) hums ominously in the middle of the street, swirling withunearthly energy.

A dude with a mohawk and a flamethrower casually steps out, his expression as calm as if he's just picking up groceries.
